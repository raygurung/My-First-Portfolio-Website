My website is about my portfolio and my resume and basic introduction to my information. I used javascript to validate the contact form and the email address.

I was able to create that and validate so i can get users to contact me who's interested in giving me a interview.

I also put the email field to register for email newsletter using validate email.

if you click on contact on bottom right, it'll take you to the form to fill in the information to contact.

i also have my dropdown menu on the main page and also html table with my experience in the past and dates.

i included various beautiful images and photos throughout the site and they all connect and compliment to each other.
